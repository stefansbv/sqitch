sqitchtutorial-mysql - A tutorial introduction to Sqitch change management on MySQL

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch *

=head1 Description

This tutorial explains how to create a sqitch-enabled MySQL project, use a VCS
for deployment planning, and work with other developers to make sure changes
remain in sync and in the proper order.

We'll start by creating new project from scratch, a fictional antisocial
networking site called Flipr. All examples use L<Git|http://git-scm.com/> as
the VCS and L<MySQL|http://dev.mysql.com/> as the storage engine.

=head1 Starting a New Project

Usually the first thing to do when starting a new project is to create a
source code repository. So let's do that with Git:

  > mkdir flipr
  > cd flipr 
  > git init .
  Initialized empty Git repository in /flipr/.git/
  > touch README.md
  > git add .
  > git commit -am 'Initialize project, add README.'
  [master (root-commit) 9c991b9] Initialize project, add README.
   1 file changed, 38 insertions(+)
   create mode 100644 README.md

If you're a Git user and want to follow along the history, the repository used
in these examples is L<on GitHub|https://github.com/theory/sqitch-mysql-intro>.

Now that we have a repository, let's get started with Sqitch. Every Sqitch
project must have a name associated with it, and, optionally, a unique URI. We
recommend including the URI, as it increases the uniqueness of object
identifiers internally, so let's specify one when we initialize Sqitch:

  > sqitch --engine mysql init flipr --uri https://github.com/theory/sqitch-mysql-intro/
  Created sqitch.conf
  Created sqitch.plan
  Created deploy/
  Created revert/
  Created verify/

Let's have a look at F<sqitch.conf>:

  > cat sqitch.conf 
  [core]
  	engine = mysql
  	# plan_file = sqitch.plan
  	# top_dir = .
  	# deploy_dir = deploy
  	# revert_dir = revert
  	# verify_dir = verify
  	# extension = sql
  # [core "mysql"]
  	# client = mysql
  	# username = 
  	# password = 
  	# db_name = 
  	# host = 
  	# port = 
  	# sqitch_db = sqitch

Good, it picked up on the fact that we're creating changes for the MySQL
engine, thanks to the C<--engine mysql> option, and saved it to the file.
Furthermore, it wrote a commented-out C<[core "mysql"]> section with all the
available MySQL engine-specific settings commented out and ready to be edited
as appropriate.

By default, Sqitch will read F<sqitch.conf> in the current directory for
settings. But it will also read F<~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf> for user-specific
settings. Since MySQL's
L<C<mysql> client|https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql.html> is not
in the path on my system, let's go ahead an tell it where to find the client
on our computer:

  > sqitch config --user core.mysql.client /opt/local/mysql/bin/psql

And let's also tell it who we are, since this data will be used in all
of our projects:

  > sqitch config --user user.name 'Marge N. O’Vera'
  > sqitch config --user user.email 'marge@example.com'

Have a look at F<~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf> and you'll see this:

  > cat ~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf
  [core "mysql"]
  	client = /opt/local/mysql/bin/psql
  [user]
  	name = Marge N. O’Vera
  	email = marge@example.com

Which means that Sqitch should be able to find C<mysql> for any project, and
that it will always properly identify us when planning and committing changes.

Back to the repository. Have a look at the plan file, F<sqitch.plan>:

  > cat sqitch.plan
  %syntax-version=1.0.0-b2
  %project=flipr
  %uri=https://github.com/theory/sqitch-mysql-intro/
  

Note that it has picked up on the name and URI of the app we're building.
Sqitch uses this data to manage cross-project dependencies. The
C<%syntax-version> pragma is always set by Sqitch, so that it always knows how
to parse the plan, even if the format changes in the future.

Let's commit these changes and start creating the database changes.

  > git add .
  > git commit -am 'Initialize Sqitch configuration.'
  [master 0738c94] Initialize Sqitch configuration.
   2 files changed, 23 insertions(+)
   create mode 100644 sqitch.conf
   create mode 100644 sqitch.plan

=head1 Our First Change

First, our app will need a database user, so let's create one. Run this
command:

  > sqitch add appuser -n 'Creates a an application user.'
  Created deploy/appuser.sql
  Created revert/appuser.sql
  Created verify/appuser.sql
  Added "appuser" to sqitch.plan

The L<C<add>|sqitch-add> command adds a database change to the plan and writes
deploy, revert, and verify scripts that represent the change. Now we edit
these files. The C<deploy> script's job is to create the table. By default,
the F<deploy/appuser.sql> file looks like this:

  -- Deploy appuser

  BEGIN;

  -- XXX Add DDLs here.

  COMMIT;

What we want to do is to replace the C<XXX> comment with the C<CREATE USER>
statement, like so:

  -- Deploy users

  BEGIN;

  CREATE USER flipr;

  COMMIT;

The C<revert> script's job is to precisely revert the change to the deploy
script, so we edit this to F<revert/appuser.sql> to look like this:

  -- Revert users

  BEGIN;

  DROP USER flipr;

  COMMIT;

Now we can try deploying this change:

  > mysql -u root --execute 'CREATE DATABASE flipr_test'
  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root deploy
  Adding metadata tables to flipr_test
  Deploying to flipr_test
    + appuser .. ok

First Sqitch created the metadata database and tables used to track database
changes. This database is separate from the database to which the C<appuser>
change was deployed; by default, it is named C<sqitch>, but if you'd like it
to have a different name, set the C<core.mysql.sqitch_db> configuration
variable:

  > sqitch config core.mysql.sqitch_db $name

Ideally, only Sqitch data will be stored in this database, so it probably makes
the most sense to create a superuser named C<sqitch> or something similar and
use it to deploy changes.

Next, Sqitch deploys changes to the destination database, which we specified
on the command-line. We only have one so far; the C<+> reinforces the idea
that the change is being I<added> to the database.

With this change deployed, if you connect to the database, you'll be able to
see the user:

  mysql -u root --execute "SELECT user from mysql.user WHERE user = 'flipr';"
  +-------+
  | User  |
  +-------+
  | flipr |
  +-------+

=head2 Trust, But Verify

But that's too much work. do you really want to do something like that after
every deploy?

Here's where the C<verify> script comes in. Its job is to test that the deploy
did was it was supposed to. It should do so without regard to any data that
might be in the database, and should throw an error if the deploy was not
successful. The simplest way to throw an error if a user does not exist is to
check the C<mysql.user> table. However, throwing an error in the event that
the user does not exist is trickier in MySQL. To simplify things, Sqitch
provides a custom function you can use in your tests, C<checkit()>. It works
kind of like a C<CHECK> constraint in other databases: pass an expression
as the first argument, and an error message as the second. If the expression
evaluates to false, an exception will be thrown with the error message.

Give it a try. Put this query into F<verify/appuser.sql>:

  SELECT sqitch.checkit(COUNT(*), 'User "flipr" dos not exist')
    FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'flipr';

This will work well as long as we know that the Sqitch database is named
C<sqitch>. If you've set C<core.mysql.sqitch_db> to a different value, you
will need to make sure you specify the correct datbase name in the script.

Now you can run the C<verify> script with the L<C<verify>|sqitch-verify>
command:

  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root verify
  Verifying flipr_test
    * appuser .. ok
  Verify successful

Looks good! If you want to make sure that the verify script correctly dies if
the table doesn't exist, temporarily change the user name in the script to
something that doesn't exist, something like:

  SELECT sqitch.checkit(COUNT(*), 'User "flipr" dos not exist')
    FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'nonesuch';

Then L<C<verify>|sqitch-verify> again:

  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root verify
  Verifying flipr_test
    * appuser .. ERROR 1644 (ERR0R) at line 5 in file: 'verify/appuser.sql': User "flipr" dos not exist
  # Verify script "verify/appuser.sql" failed.
  not ok

  Verify Summary Report
  ---------------------
  Changes: 1
  Errors:  1
  Verify failed

The C<checkit()> function is kind enough to use the error message to tell us
what the problem is. Don't forget to change the table name back before
continuing!

=head2 Status, Revert, Log, Repeat

For purely informational purposes, we can always see how a deployment was
recorded via the L<C<status>|sqitch-status> command, which reads the tables
from the metadata database:

  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root status
  # On database flipr_test
  # Project:  flipr
  # Change:   df801cddbb329ee14e6641670a214804f4384129
  # Name:     appuser
  # Deployed: 2013-07-01 18:42:51 +0200
  # By:       Marge N. O’Vera <marge@example.com>
  # 
  Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)

Let's make sure that we can revert the change:

  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root revert
  Revert all changes from flipr_test? [Yes]
    - appuser .. ok

The L<C<revert>|sqitch-revert> command first prompts to make sure that we
really do want to revert. This is to prevent unnecessary accidents. You can
pass the C<-y> option to disable the prompt. Also, notice the C<-> before the
change name in the output, which reinforces that the change is being
I<removed> from the database. And now the schema should be gone:

  > mysql -u root --execute "SELECT user from mysql.user WHERE user = 'flipr';"

And the status message should reflect as much:

  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root status
  # On database flipr_test
  No changes deployed

Of course, since nothing is deployed, the L<C<verify>|sqitch-verify> command
has nothing to verify:

  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root verify
  Verifying flipr_test
  No changes deployed

However, we still have a record that the change happened, visible via the
L<C<log>|sqitch-log> command:

  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root log
  On database flipr_test
  Revert df801cddbb329ee14e6641670a214804f4384129
  Name:      appuser
  Committer: Marge N. O’Vera <marge@example.com>
  Date:      2013-07-01 20:55:51 +0200

      Creates a an application user.

  Deploy df801cddbb329ee14e6641670a214804f4384129
  Name:      appuser
  Committer: Marge N. O’Vera <marge@example.com>
  Date:      2013-07-01 18:42:51 +0200

      Creates a an application user.

Note that the actions we took are shown in reverse chronological order, with
the revert first and then the deploy.

Cool. Now let's commit it.

  > git add .
  > git commit -m 'Add the "flipr" user.'
  [new 700df87] Add the "flipr" user.
   4 files changed, 23 insertions(+)
   create mode 100644 deploy/appuser.sql
   create mode 100644 revert/appuser.sql
   create mode 100644 verify/appuser.sql

And then deploy again. This time, let's use the C<--verify> option, so that
the C<verify> script is applied when the change is deployed:

  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root deploy
  Deploying changes to flipr_test
	+ appuser .. ok

And now the C<flipr> user should be back:

  > mysql -u root --execute "SELECT user from mysql.user WHERE user = 'flipr';"
  +-------+
  | user  |
  +-------+
  | flipr |
  +-------+

When we look at the status, the deployment will be there:

  > sqitch --db-name flipr_test --db-user root status
  # On database flipr_test
  # Project:  flipr
  # Change:   df801cddbb329ee14e6641670a214804f4384129
  # Name:     appuser
  # Deployed: 2013-07-01 20:57:54 +0200
  # By:       Marge N. O’Vera <marge@example.com>
  # 
  Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)

=head1 More Configuration

I'm getting a little tired of always having to type
C<--db-user root --db-name flipr_test>, aren't you? Let's just make that the
default, shall we?

  > sqitch config core.mysql.username root
  > sqitch config core.mysql.db_name flipr_test

Now we can leave it out, unless we need to deploy to another database. Which
we will, eventually, but at least our examples will be simpler from here on
in, e.g.:

  > sqitch status
  # On database flipr_test
  # Project:  flipr
  # Change:   df801cddbb329ee14e6641670a214804f4384129
  # Name:     appuser
  # Deployed: 2013-07-01 20:57:54 +0200
  # By:       Marge N. O’Vera <marge@example.com>
  # 
  Nothing to deploy (up-to-date)

Yay, that allows things to be a little more concise. Let's also make sure that
changes are verified after deploying them:

  > sqitch config --bool deploy.verify true
  > sqitch config --bool rebase.verify true

We'll see the L<C<rebase>|sqitch-rebase> command a bit later. In the meantime,
let's commit the new configuration and and make some more changes!

  > git commit -am 'Set default DB name and always verify.'
  [master bb35c99] Set default DB name and always verify.
   1 file changed, 7 insertions(+)

=head1 More to Come

Sqitch is a work in progress. Better integration with version control systems
is planned to make managing idempotent reworkings even easier. Stay tuned.
