=head1 Name

sqitch-deploy - Deploy changes to a database

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] deploy
  sqitch [options] deploy <target>
  sqitch [options] deploy --to-target <target>

=head1 Description

Deploy changes to the database. Changes will begin from the current deployment
state. They will run to the latest change, unless a target is specified, either
via C<--to> or with no option flag, in which case changes will be deployed
up-to and including that target.

If the database it up-to-date or already deployed to the specified target, no
changes will be made. If the target appears earlier in the plan than the
currently-deployed state, an error will be returned, along with a suggestion
to instead use L<sqitch-revert>.

=head1 Options

=over

=item C<--to-target>

=item C<--target>

=item C<--to>

Specify the deployment target. Defaults to the last point in the plan. See
L<sqitchchanges> for the various ways in which change targets can be
specified.

=item C<--mode>

Specify the reversion mode to use in case of failure. Possible values are:

=over

=item C<all>

In the event of failure, revert all deployed changes, back to the point at
which deployment started. This is the default.

=item C<tag>

In the event of failure, revert all deployed changes to the last
successfully-applied tag. If no tags were applied during this deployment, all
changes will be reverted to the point at which deployment began.

=item C<change>

In the event of failure, no changes will be reverted. This is on the
assumption that a change is atomic, and thus may may be deployed again.

=back

=item C<--verify>

Verify each change by running its verify script, if there is one. If a verify
test fails, the deploy will be considered to have failed and the appropriate
reversion will be carried out, depending on the value of C<--mode>.

=item C<--no-verify>

Don't verify each change. This is the default.

=item C<-s>

=item C<--set>

Set a variable name and value for use by the database engine client, if it
supports variables. The format must be C<name=value>, e.g.,
C<--set defuser='Homer Simpson'>. Overrides any values loaded from the
C<deploy.variables> configuration.

=item C<--log-only>

Log the changes as if they were deployed, but without actually running the
deploy scripts. Useful for an existing database that is being converted to
Sqitch, and you need to log changes as deployed because they have been
deployed by other means in the past.

=back

=head1 Configuration Variables

=over

=item C<deploy.to_target>

Target to deploy to. You probably don't want to set this.

=item C<deploy.mode>

Deploy mode. The supported values are the same as for the C<--mode> option.

=item C<deploy.verify>

Boolean indicating whether or not to verify each change.

=item C<[deploy.variables]>

A section defining database client variables. Useful if your database engine
supports variables in scripts, such as PostgreSQL's
L<C<psql> variables|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-INTERPOLATION>
and SQL*Plus's
L<C<DEFINE> variables|http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/ch12017.htm>.

=back

=head1 Sqitch

Part of the L<sqitch> suite.
