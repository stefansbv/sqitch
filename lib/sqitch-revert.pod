=head1 Name

sqitch-revert - Revert changes to a database

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] revert
  sqitch [options] revert <target>
  sqitch [options] revert --to-target <target>

=head1 Description

Revert changes to the database. Starting from the current deployment state,
changes will be reverted in reverse the order of application. All changes will
be reverted unless a target is specified, either via C<--to> or with no option
flag, in which case changes will be reverted back to that target.

If the database has not been deployed to, or its state already matches the
specified target, no changes will be made. If the target appears later in the
plan than the currently-deployed state, an error will be returned, along with
a suggestion to instead use L<sqitch-deploy>.

=item C<[deploy.variables]>

=item C<[revert.variables]>

A section defining database client variables. The C<deploy.variables>
configuration is read from the C<deploy> command configuration, on the
assumption that the values will generally be the same. If they're not, use
C<revert.variables> to override C<deploy.variables>.

These variables are Useful if your database engine supports variables in
scripts, such as PostgreSQL's
L<C<psql> variables|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-INTERPOLATION>
and SQL*Plus's
L<C<DEFINE> variables|http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/ch12017.htm>.
